~HAWAIIAN ROLLS~
source: ericasrecipes.com, process modified by me (hand-knead instead of mixer + dough hook; brush w/ sweet butter)
servings: 32 rolls

INGREDIENTS
-2c + 2tbsp pineapple juice, divided (2tbsp for glazing later)
-1/2c + 1tbsp sugar, divided (1tbsp for later)
-2tsp kosher salt
-1/3c coconut oil, melted
-2/3c warm water
-4.5tsp active dry yeast
-7-8c bread flour
-2tbsp vegan butter, melted
-2tsp brown sugar

PROCESS:
Preheat oven to 375F. Dissolve 1/2c sugar and 2tsp salt in the 2c of pineapple juice in a small bowl. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the remaining 1tbsp of sugar in the 
warm water. Add yeast and proof 10mins. Add the pineapple juice/sugar mixture and coconut oil to the proofed yeast and water, and stir to combine. Sift in flour 1c at a time until 
dough is not overly sticky (~7.5c). Turn out onto a clean countertop and knead for 10mins. Put the dough in a warm place and let rise for 1hr. Turn out dough on your lightly floured 
clean surface, and knead to incorporate flour. Divide the dough in half, and continue to do so with each half, until you have 32 balls of dough. Grease 2 9x13 glass baking dishes
(or do one batch at a time, like I did) and let dough rise for 40mins. Once risen, brush tops of rolls with remaining pineapple juice. Bake for 30mins until golden brown, and brush
with a mixture of vegan butter and brown sugar when they are fresh out of the oven.
