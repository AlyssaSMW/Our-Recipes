CAKE
-2c AP flour
-1 1/4c white sugar
-2tsp baking soda
-1/2tsp salt
-1/3c EVOO
-2 flax eggs (2tbsp flax meal + 6tbsp water = 2 flax eggs)
-1tsp vanilla extract
-2-3 bananas, mashed (2 if large, 3 if medium)
-1/2c mix-ins (originally blueberries, I used a combo of walnuts and chocolate chips and it was amazing)

SWIRL
-2tbsp brown sugar
-2tsp cinnamon
-1tsp cardamom

STREUSEL TOP
-1/2c AP flour
-1/4c white sugar
-1/4c brown sugar
-1tsp cinnamon
-6tsp VERY cold vegan butter

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 350F and grease a 9-inch (or tall 8-inch) round glass dish. In a large bowl, add the dry cake ingredients and whisk together. Make a well in the center and add wet 
cake ingredients. Stir until smooth, and fold in mix-ins. In a small bowl, combine swirl ingredients and whisk. Pour half of the cake batter into the greased glass dish, evenly distribute 
the swirl mix, and then evenly add the rest of the batter on top. For the streusel top, add all dry ingredients into a bowl and whisk. Using your fingers, cut the butter into the flour 
mixture in pea-sized pieces, and work through until the streusel is rough & chunky and even. Add on top of the cake, and bake for 1 hour before testing the middle. If needed, tent the 
cake with foil and bake until done in 15min increments, checking the cake each time. Mine took around 2-2.5hrs total to bake with tightly wrapped foil on top due to the height of the 
cake. It still came out perfect! Just make sure your foil is tightly wrapped on top to prevent moisture loss.
