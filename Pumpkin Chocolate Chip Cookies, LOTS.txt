servings: I forgot, 12+ cookies?

INGREDIENTS
-1/2c coconut oil (I used softened vegan butter originally)
-3/4c dark brown sugar, packed
-1/2c white sugar
-2tsp vanilla extract
-2tbsp molasses
-2tbsp vegan milk
-1/3c pumpkin puree
~DRY~
-2 1/4c AP flour
-1tsp baking soda
-1/2tsp kosher salt, more for sprinkling on top
-1tsp cinnamon 
-1/2tsp cardamom
-1/2tsp turmeric
1.5c chocolate chips, plus more for topping

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 375F and line a large cookie sheet with a silpat. In a standing mixer, beat the coconut oil, both sugars, and vanilla on medium speed for 2mins, until smooth. Add in the 
molasses, milk, and pumpkin puree and mix on low until combined. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients and whisk. Add the dry ingredients into the wet, and mix on low 
speed until combined. The batter should be very thick. Fold in the 1.5c chocolate chips. Scoop desired amount of cookies onto lined cookie sheet, and bake for 8-9mins, pulling the tray 
out halfway through to give a few rough taps on the stovetop before returning to the oven for the remainder of the baking time (this spreads out the chocolate and creates a neat texture, and is purely optional). Pull out of oven, press a few extra chocolate chips into each cookie, and sprinkle with sea salt. Let cool on cookie sheet for 20mins before transferring to cooling rack. Between batches, store bowl of cookie dough in fridge.
