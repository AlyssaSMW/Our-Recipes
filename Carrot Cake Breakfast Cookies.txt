servings: 12

INGREDIENTS
-1c quick oats (old fashioned works too)
-1c AP flour
-1tsp baking powder
-1tsp cinnamon
-1/2tsp kosher salt
-1/4c ground ginger
-1.5c peeled grated carrots

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 375F. Line large cookie sheet with silpat. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients and whisk to blend. Add carrots, nuts, and any other mix-ins and stir to combine. 
In a medium bowl, combine syrup and coconut oil. Whisk until blended, and pour into dry ingredient mixture. Stir until just combined, and no raw flour pockets are left. Drop 1/4c scoops 
of dough onto the cookie sheet, evenly spaced out with a little extra room. Bake until cookies are firm around the edges, about 15-17mins. Cool on cookie sheet for 10mins, and then 
transfer to rack. When fully cooled, spoon on or dip cookie in icing. Keeps for 2 days room temp, 5 days in fridge, or 3 months in freezer.
