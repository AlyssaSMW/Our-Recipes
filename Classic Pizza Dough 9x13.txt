~PIZZA DOUGH~
source: NY Times cooking, modified by me (no cook temp or time was listed, cold ferment)
servings: 2 8in pizzas

INGREDIENTS
153g (1c + 1tbsp) 00 Flour (bread or more AP flour works in a pinch)
153g (1c + 1tbsp) AP flour
8g (1tsp) sea salt
200g warm water
2g (3/4tsp) active dry yeast
4g (1tsp) EVOO

PROCESS
In a large mixing bowl, sift in the flours and add the salt. In a small mixing bowl, stir together warm water, yeast, and olive oil, and pour into dry ingredient bowl. Knead for 
3 minutes, and rest 15mins. Knead again until the dough doesn't stick to your hands. Do NOT add any extra flour. Divide dough into 2 equal balls, put both into greased bowls, cover with 
a lid or some foil, and let rise in the fridge overnight or up to 24hrs. 2-3 hours before you intend to make pizza, take the bowl(s) out of the fridge, and allow them to come up to room 
temp on the countertop. Preheat the oven to 445F during the last hour. Once oven is preheated, turn dough out onto a large silpat-lined baking sheet sprinkled with semolina (or cornmeal), 
and stretch to edges. Top with sauce, toppings, and cheese of choice. Bake on the bottom rack for 5mins, and then transfer to the middle rack to bake for 8-10mins. Remove from oven, cut, 
and serve.
