HALF BATCH CHOCOLATE SHEET CAKE 9x9 - FORMATTED FOR ALYSSA

MATERIALS
Preheat oven to 350F
-8x8 square glass baking pan or round 8in cake pan
-1 large mixing bowl
-Sifter
-1 medium mixing bowl
-Soft spatula
-Whisk
-All measuring cups
-Measuring spoons
-Liquid measure
-Cooling rack

PROCESS/INGREDIENTS

1. Preheat oven to 350F and put a few drops of oil into your baking pan, spreading it throughout the pan with a piece of paper towel - add another drop or two of oil if necessary.

2. In a sifter over your LARGE mixing bowl, add the following:
-1 1/3 cup flour
-2 TABLEspoons cocoa powder (this is the only time you will be using the tablespoon)
-3/4 teaspoon baking soda
Sift into the bowl, and rub the remaining lumps through the mesh if possible. Discard whatever is left in the sifter. You are now done with the sifter.

3. To the LARGE mixing bowl, now add:
-3/4 cup white sugar
-2 teaspoons instant coffee
-1/2 teaspoon salt
Using the soft spatula, gently mix contents of the large mixing bowl until combined.

4. To the MEDIUM mixing bowl, add:
-3/4 cup of oat milk (use liquid measure)
-1/4 cup of sunflower oil (use liquid measure)
-2 teaspoons vanilla extract (use measuring spoons)
-1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar (under the sink)
Whisk to combine.

5. Pour the liquid contents of the MEDIUM mixing bowl into the LARGE mixing bowl, scraping it down with the soft spatula. Whisk the ingredients together until there are no lumps left, but be careful not to overmix. Be sure to gently scrape the bottom with the whisk to check for hidden pockets of dry ingredients.

6. Pour the batter into your greased 9x9 glass baking pan, scraping the bowl clean with the spatula. Wipe up any mess on the cake tin. Place the pan into the oven, and bake for 25mins. Check the center of the cake with a toothpick: if the toothpick is clean or has a few formed crumbs clinging to it, the cake is done. If there is still some liquid batter, tent the cake with foil and bake another 5-6mins and recheck with a new toothpick. Repeat until done.

7. Set pan on a cooling rack completely before frosting (Recipe below). This will likely take 4+ hours.


HALF BATCH VANILLA FROSTING

MATERIALS
-Stand mixer with whisk attachment
-Soft spatula
-Lidded container to store extra frosting in if needed
-1 cup & 1/4 cup measuring cups
-Measuring spoon
-Mini chocolate chips

1. In the standing mixer, add the following:
-1/4 cup vegan butter, softened if possible
-1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons oat milk
-1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
And mix on high with the whisk attachment until combined. Scrape down the sides with the spatula as needed.

2. Add in 2 1/4 cups of powdered sugar and mix on LOW until it begins to combine. Once no longer powdery, stop mixing and scrape down sides. Now mix on high for 2-3 minutes, or until the frosting is nice and fluffy. Scrape down sides as needed (when stuff on the edges is thinner than the insides).

3. Spread a thick layer of frosting (all of it if desired!) onto the cake with the spatula, ensuring it's evenly distributed. Sprinkle cake with mini chocolate chips.
