Lightly Sweet Turmeric Chai Surprise Snickerdoodles 12ct
Recipe: Modified from Chocolate Covered Katie

INGREDIENTS
-1.5c AP flour
-1/2c sugar
-3/4tsp baking soda
-1/2tsp each of: salt, baking powder, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom
-6tbsp oil (olive, melted coconut, melted vegan butter, or a combo; I used 4tbsp coconut oil to 2tbsp olive oil)
-3tbsp plant milk, unsweetened
-1tsp each of: vanilla extract, almond extract

TOPPING
-1/4c sugar
-1tbsp chai spice blend (majority cinnamon & ginger, and then to your liking: turmeric, cardamom, clove, allspice, nutmeg, black pepper)

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 325F. In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients and mix. Add butter, and 1tbsp of plant milk at a time - dough will be extremely thick and a bit crumbly. Add plant milk until no longer crumbly and dough can form a ball (may need more than 3tbsp, but 3 is roughly what I used). Form said ball in bowl, and chill for 30mins while oven preheats. Whisk together topping blend in a small mixing bowl. Form dough into 12 even balls and roll in topping mix. Place on large cookie sheet lined with a silpat. Bake for 11-13mins, and cool for 10mins. They will be lightly sweet, and the insides will be bright orange from the turmeric!
