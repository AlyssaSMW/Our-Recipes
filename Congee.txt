~GOOD CONGEE~
Source: Omnivorescookbook.com

Ideal rice: short grain white, but any other white rice works as well. Adjust water 1c up for brown rices.

RATIOS
Thick congee: 1/2c rice to 8c water
Medium congee: 1/2c rice to 10c water
Soupy congee: 1/2c rice to 12c water

PROCESS
Rinse the rice, and add it to your desired amount of water in a pot. If desired, add soy sauce, miso, or herbs/spices/etc to taste. Bring to a boil, stirring a few times. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer, and cover the pot halfway. Simmer 45-50mins, stirring a few times during cooking. Toward the end of the cook time, the congee will thicken up quick, so keep an eye on it and stir frequently for the final 10mins. If needed, add more water for desired texture. Serve with any toppings you like! My favorite is miso, low sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, a little cheddar, and crumbled roasted chestnuts.
