SWEET POTATO COFFEE CAKE LOAF
Developed from: domesticgothess.com
Servings: 1 loaf

INGREDIENTS

STREUSEL
-2/3c AP Flour
-1/3c brown sugar, NOT packed
-1tsp cinnamon
-1/2tsp cardamom
-1/4tsp salt
-1/4c coconut oil, cold/solid
-1/4c chopped nuts, I used walnuts
-1/4c shredded coconut, I used sweetened

STREUSEL PROCESS
In a small mixing bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, salt, and spices. Add coconut oil, and work with hands until a coarse crumb is achieved. Mix in nuts and shredded coconut, and set aside. This is A LOT and it's good this way, but a half recipe would suffice just fine for less mess & sweetness.

LOAF
-1 2/3c AP flour
-1.5tsp baking powder
-1/2tsp baking soda
-1tsp cinnamon
-1tsp ginger
-1tsp turmeric
-1/2tsp cloves
-1/4tsp nutmeg
-1/4tsp salt
-1c sweet potato puree (1 large sweet potato roasted in foil @ 425F for 1+hr, cooled & blended)
-1/3c sunflower oil, or any neutral liquid oil
-1/2c unsweetened vegan milk
-1tsp apple cider vinegar
-1/2c sugar
-1/3c brown sugar

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 350F and grease a loaf tin. If available, place a strip of parchment paper longwise in the pan for easy lifting out.
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients except for sugars. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together wet ingredients including sugars. Gradually fold in dry ingredients to wet ingredients with a flexible spatula until no dry spots remain. Transfer batter to loaf tin, and evenly distribute above streusel on top and gently press down (it will seem like A LOT). Bake for ~70mins, or until a toothpick comes out clean and it doesn't feel liquidy. Cool in tin for an hour, and then pull or tip out (messier but doable) loaf onto a cooling rack. Wait a couple hours, and glaze (below). Cool completely before serving. 

FRENCH TOAST GLAZE
-2/3c powdered sugar
-1tsp cinnamon
-1/2tsp vanilla extract
-few drops maple extract
-1tbsp vegan milk

PROCESS
Whisk above ingredients to texture/taste. You want a thick glaze that can drizzle by itself. Drizzle onto mostly cooled loaf.
