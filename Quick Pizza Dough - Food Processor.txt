Recipe origin: food.com, no-knead food processor thin crust pizza dough
Serving size: 1 12in thin crust

INGREDIENTS
-2c AP flour
-1.5tsp instant yeast

-Any mix-ins (I did 1tsp garlic powder, and a few shakes of oregano, basil, and parsley)

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 475F. In large food processor (not kitchenaid 3-cup...), pulse the dry ingredients together to mix. Add in wet ingredients, and process on dough setting until a ball forms. Transfer ball to greased mixing bowl, cover with a towel, and let rest 10mins. Stretch dough out onto cookie sheet/pizza pan/etc, top, and bake on the bottom rack for 5mins. After that, transfer to center rack and bake another 5-8mins (longer for more/wetter toppings).
