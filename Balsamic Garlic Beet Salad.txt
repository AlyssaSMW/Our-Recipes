-4 beets, washed with tops & tails trimmed
-1tbsp vegan butter
-4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
-2tsp balsamic vinegar

Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the beets on a lined cookie sheet and roast for 50mins, or until soft enough to put a knife through it. Let cool until they can be handled comfortably, and 
peel off skin. Slice beets thinly. Heat a medium/large pan on the stovetop on medium-low. Add butter and garlic, and cook gently until garlic is lightly toasted and the flavor is infused 
into the butter. Toss sliced beets in the mixture, remove from heat, and put in container to chill in fridge. Add balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and green onions, toss to combine & serve.
