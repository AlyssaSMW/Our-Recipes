Lemony Vegan Mushroom Stew
Modified from: Holycowvegan.net

INGREDIENTS
-1 medium onion, finely diced
-4 cloves garlic, chopped
-1tsp EVOO
-1/4c wine, any kind (I subbed sherry, but a red would be great)
-1tbsp flour
-1tbsp tomato paste
-1 medium tomato, finely diced
-2tbsp dried herbs (I used a blend of sage, rosemary, & thyme - lavender is also recommended!)
-2tsp soy sauce or equivalent
-1c veggie stock
-16oz mushrooms, sliced
-1 large russet potato; peeled, diced, & pre-roasted (optional - add in with stock)
-1/4c fresh parsley, chopped
-1/2 a lemon's worth of juice and zest

PROCESS
Heat oil in a large lidded saucepan with high sides. Saute onions, garlic, salt, pepper, & dried herbs until the onions start to soften, 2-3mins. Add the wine, and stir until slightly reduced. Add the flour and stir for a couple of minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan with 
your stirring utensil. Add the tomato paste, stir it in, and add tomatoes. Let the mixture cook down for 2-3mins. Add the mushrooms and 
saute until they begin to release their liquid, and then add the soy sauce & veggie stock. Allow mixture to come to a boil, and then simmer for 10mins. Add extra stock or water if looking too dry, and re-season to taste. During the last 2 minutes of simmering, add in the parsley and lemon zest and stir. Once those few minutes are up, turn off the heat and let sit for a few before adding in your lemon juice. Serve over rice, polenta, with crusty bread, or by itself.
