source: charlotteslivelykitchen.com
servings: 12 scones (original recipe doubled)

INGREDIENTS
-500g self-raising flour (1tbsp baking powder + 1tsp salt + flour on top to equal 500g) ALT: 3c +2 tbsp flour, 2tsp baking powder, 1tsp salt
-100g coconut oil, solid (preferably chilled in the fridge for a little while) ALT: 1/4c + 3tbsp 
-60g white sugar ALT: 1/4c
-1tsp baking powder
-1/2tsp salt
-280ml vegan milk (chilled) ALT: 1c + 3tbsp

PROCESS
Preheat the oven to 220C (Approx. 430F) and line a large cookie sheet with a silpat. Sift the self-raising flour blend into a large mixing bowl. Add the coconut oil and mix with hands 
until the consistency is breadcrumb-like (kind of like making pie dough). Add the rest of the dry ingredients, and mix to combine. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add 
most of the vegan milk, saving a couple tablespoons back to help pick up dry bits later on. Gently mix the milk into the ingredients until it creates a shaggy ball of dough. Add 
the extra milk to help the dry bits at the bottom of the bowl come together with the dough ball. Lightly flour a clean surface, and turn dough out. Pat dough into a circle about 
1.5in tall. Divide it in half, and divide those halves in half, etc until you have 12 triangle-shaped scones. Carefully place scones on cookie sheet, and bake for 13mins. Serve 
immediately with vegan butter & jam!
