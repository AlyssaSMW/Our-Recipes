-2tsp vanilla extract
-2tsp white vinegar
-1/2c pumpkin puree
-2tbsp olive oil
PROCESS: Whisk together dry ingredients, and fold in wet ingredients until no lumps remain. Do not overmix.

OVERALL PROCESS: Grease a 9x13 glass baking dish and preheat the oven to 350. Spread half the cake batter into the bottom of the pan. Top 
with all the filling, and gently drizzle the remaining half of the coffee cake batter over top. It will be difficult to get an even full 
layer on top of the powdery filling, so don't worry if it swirls a bit, just make sure there are few dry patches on the top of the batter. 
Evenly cover with crumb topping, and bake for 35mins, inserting a toothpick in the center to ensure doneness. If not done, cover in foil 
and bake in 5min increments until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cake cool completely, and evenly drizzle glaze over the top.
