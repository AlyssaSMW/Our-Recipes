-1tsp turmeric, ground
-1tsp garam masala

-salt & pepper to taste

PROCESS
Heat oil in dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery and cook 8-10mins, or until soft. Add garlic, turmeric, garam masala, and smoked paprika; cook 2mins stirring frequently, until spices and garlic become fragrant. Stir in thyme, bay leaf, and peas. Stir well to coat peas in mixture. Add broth and salt & pepper. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer covered for an hour. Uncover, and mash some of the split peas against the edge of the pot if desired to make it creamier. Simmer for another 15mins if you want your split peas softer. Remove bay leaf, and serve with mushroom bacon on top.
