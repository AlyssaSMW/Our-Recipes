Source: Modified from Minimalist Baker
Servings: 10 rolls

INGREDIENTS

*DOUGH
-3tbsp vegan butter (sub some with coconut oil or olive oil fine)
-1c unsweetened plant milk
-1 packet/2 1/4tsp yeast
-1tbsp sugar
-1/4tsp salt
-2tsp cinnamon
-3c AP flour

*FILLING
-3tbsp vegan butter (sub some with coconut oil or olive oil fine)
-1/4c sugar (or half and half brown and white sugar)
-2tsp cinnamon
-1tsp other spices (cardamom, ginger, clove, nutmeg, allspice, turmeric, etc. Feel free to play with ratio for all)

*TOPPING
-2tbsp vegan butter (optional, will crisp up top nicely)

PROCESS
Grease an 8x8 pan with olive or coconut oil, or vegan butter. In a small pot, heat the milk and butter until warm and melted. Remove from 
heat and let cool to around 110F. Transfer mixture to mixing bowl and add sugar and yeast. Let proof. Add salt and cinnamon, and add the 
flour 1/2c at a time, stirring as you go. Knead around in bowl for a couple minutes until a smooth dough is formed. Coat dough and inside of bowl in olive oil, throw a towel over the bowl, and let rise in a warm space for 1-2hrs or until doubled in size. After rising, on a lightly floured surface, turn out your dough and roll out until around 1/4in thick. Brush on melted vegan butter evenly, and sprinkle your sugar & spice mixture all over the dough. Tightly roll longwise until a log is formed. Score the log with a serrated knife in 2in segments. Use a length of floss to cut the pieces. Place your rolls in your greased baking dish, and let rise for another 30mins on top of the oven while it preheats to 350F. This is where you would brush more butter on top of your rolls if desired. Once risen, bake for 25mins. Let cool for around 10mins, then frost (recipe below).
