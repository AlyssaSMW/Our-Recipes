Combine broth ingredients in a large pot on medium-low, whisk until combined. Broth is ready when steaming. Add 4oz of dry soy curls to pot and let soak for 15mins, stirring halfway
through. While soy curls are soaking, whisk together marinade ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Strain soy curls, let cool slightly in colander, and press any extra liquid out.
Add soy curls to marinade bowl, toss to coat, and marinate. Preheat the oven to 385F, and let soy curls marinate until oven is preheated. Line a large baking sheet with a silpat,
drain the excess marinade off of the soy curls, and spread them out evenly on the lined baking sheet. Bake for 30mins, stirring halfway through. Edges should be crispy any soy curls
should be tender.
