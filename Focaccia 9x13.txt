source: bonappetit.com, heavily modified by me
servings: 1 9x13 THICK loaf of focaccia

INGREDIENTS
-2 1/4tsp active dry yeast
-2.5c warm water
-2tsp white sugar
-5c AP flour, sifted
-3tsp kosher salt
-6tbsp EVOO, divided (4tbsp for now, 2tbsp for later)
-2tbsp butter
-Any desired mix-ins, chopped (herbs, garlic, cheese, peppers, etc etc)
-Any desired toppings (Again, garlic, cheese, peppers, etc etc)

PROCESS
In your largest mixing bowl, add the yeast, warm water, and sugar in a bowl and let proof for 5mins. Sift in the 5c of flour. Add the salt and any mix-ins, and mix until there are no 
dry flour pockets left. Pour 4tbsp EVOO into a large lidded bowl, and scrape dough into bowl with spatula. Turn dough around in oil to coat fully, put lid on, and let sit in fridge 
overnight. The next day, pull the dough out and place onto countertop for 4hrs to come up to temp. Butter a 9x13 glass baking dish, and add 1tbsp of EVOO into it. Open your dough bowl, 
and using forks, pull the dough inward from the edges on all sides until mostly unstuck from bowl. Dump dough out into baking dish, using your hands to make sure as much as possible 
comes out, and get as much oil out of the bowl as possible. Turn dough around in pan to coat with extra oil, and allow to rise at room temp for 1.5-2hrs, uncovered. Preheat oven to 
450F. Lightly oil your hands, and poke a bunch of holes into the risen dough to deflate/make a bunch of pockets. Sprinkle some salt evenly across dough, add desired toppings, and drizzle remaining EVOO over top. Bake for 25-30mins.
