~WHOLE ROASTED CAULIFLOWER~

INGREDIENTS
-1 Whole head cauliflower
-1/3c Olive oil
-1/2tsp salt
-Whatever seasoning you want

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 400F. Rinse and pat dry cauliflower head. Remove stem and leaves, and carefully cut the bottom so it lays flat. In a small 
bowl, whisk together the olive oil and your seasonings to make a thin paste. Place the trimmed cauliflower upside down in a dutch oven, and 
pour half your seasoning paste over it. Let it sit for a minute to allow the seasoning to drip down through the florets. Flip the 
cauliflower over and drizzle the other half of the marinade on top, using a silicone brush to ensure the seasoning is evenly spread over 
the cauliflower. Place the lid on the dutch oven, and place it in the oven for 40mins, or until the cauliflower is tender.
