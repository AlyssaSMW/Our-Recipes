~SUPER EASY DUTCH OVEN BREAD~
source: jocooks.com, sent to me from Brianna
servings: 1 loaf

-1.5c AP flour, sifted
-1.5c bread flour, sifted (either ratio of either flour just fine, this is my preferred)
-1.5tsp salt
-1/2tsp active dry yeast
1.5c water, room temp
-Any mix-ins or spices you want, to taste

PROCESS:
Mix flour, salt, yeast, & mix-ins together in large lidded bowl. Add water and mix until no dry pockets of flour remain. Put lid on bowl and leave on countertop overnight. Preheat oven
to 450F with dutch oven inside of it. Remove pot, and remove lid (REMEMBER TO USE OVEN MITTS). Flour your hands and sprinkle some on the bottom of the dutch oven, remove dough from bowl, 
shape into a ball, and plop into the dutch oven. Put the lid back onto the dutch oven, and replace into the oven for 30mins with the lid on. After 30mins, remove the lid and bake for 
another 15-20mins. Remove bread from pot and let cool fully on cooling rack.
