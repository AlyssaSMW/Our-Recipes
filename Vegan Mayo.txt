~VEGAN MAYO~
source: FB comment in Vegan chef group by Aaron Firkus
Servings: An entire container of mayo, feel free to 1/2 or 1/4 the recipe

INGREDIENTS
-1/2c aquafaba
-1tsp acid (lemon juice preferred, but ACV, Pickle juice, hot sauce, balsamic vinegar, white vinegar, etc)
-1tsp dijon mustard
-~1 1/4c neutral oil (You may need less or more, and I used veggie oil)
-Seasonings as desired (roasted garlic, garlic powder, pesto, chipotle powder, etc)

PROCESS
All ingredients should be room temp, or as close to it as possible. Mix all ingredients except oil in a cup large enough to accomodate an immersion blender, then add 1/4c of  oil at a time, streaming in gently, until mixture thickens. Transfer to an airtight container, but do not put the lid on yet, as it will still be a bit runny and warm. 
It will continue to thicken up as it cools in the fridge.
