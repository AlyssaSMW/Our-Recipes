PROCESS
Preheat oven to 375F. In a large skillet over medium high, add olive oil, carrot, onion, and dried herbs/spices. Saute for a few minutes until the vegetables soften, then add garlic and kalamata olives and saute until fragrant. Add the can of tomatoes (or blended red peppers) and the beans. Cook for 5mins on high heat. Taste for salt and seasoning, add more if you need to, and transfer to baking dish (I used and 8x5 I believe?) if your skillet is not oven safe. Add the bay leaf, the fresh herbs, and enough of liquid of choice to be even with the top of the ingredients. Stir well, even out on top, and bake for 30mins until thickened and top layer is golden brown. Serve over rice and/or with crusty bread at any temp (I prefer just warmed), and top with feta, more fresh herbs, olive oil, black pepper, and lemon juice if desired.
