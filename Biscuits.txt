VEGAN BISCUITS
Recipe source: holycowvegan.net
Servings: 12-16 biscuits, depending

INGREDIENTS
-2c AP flour
-2tsp baking powder
-1/2tsp baking soda
-1/2tsp salt
-6tbsp very cold vegan butter
-1c very cold non-dairy milk
-1tsp liquid acid (like lemon juice or ACV)
-2tsp herbs/spices, as desired
-1/2c mix-ins, like cheese, chopped jalapenos, etc

PROCESS
Mix the non-dairy milk with ACV and set aside to curdle into buttermilk. Put the dry ingredients (including herbs and/or seasonings) in a large mixing bowl, and whisk to combine. Add the cold butter in small chunks, and use your hands to cut the butter into the flour - the texture should be coarse and sandy. Drizzle in the vegan buttermilk, and mix until the dough forms. The dough should be wet enough to form into a ball, but not too wet. Flatten the dough into a disc and refrigerate for 10mins minimum. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees at this point. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/2in thickness. Use a cookie cutter (I used a 1/3c measure, 1/2c for 12 biscuits I would think) and cut the dough. Re-roll the scraps and re-cut them until you have no usable dough left. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet evenly spaced apart, brush with a mix of 1:1 oil:milk, and bake for 14mins.
