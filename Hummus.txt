serving: one...thing? of hummus. A good amount. 2-3 cups.

INGREDIENTS
-1 can chickpeas, drained & rinsed
-1/2tsp baking soda
-1/4c lemon juice (1 lemon)
-2-3 cloves garlic
-1/2tsp kosher salt
-1/2c tahini
-2-4tbsp ice water, as needed for texture
-1/2tsp ground cumin
-1tbsp EVOO
-Any mix-ins you like, to taste (roasted garlic, buffalo sauce, roasted red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, other spices, etc)
-Any toppings you like (I normally go for EVOO/pepperolio, paprika, parsley, and sambal oelek)

PROCESS
Place chickpeas and baking soda into a medium saucepan. Cover chickpeas by a couple inches with water. Boil 20mins, strain in a sieve, and run cool water over them until they are no longer 
hot. Meanwhile, add lemon, salt, and garlic into a food processor and pulse to chop garlic. Let sit for 10mins (while chickpeas are boiling). Add tahini to food processor and blend until 
mixture is thick, scrape down sides and bottom with spatula as needed. Drizzle in 2tbsp ice water, and blend until mixture is smooth, pale, and creamy. Add spices, dry mix-ins, and 
chickpeas and blend. Drizzle in olive oil and any liquid mix-ins. Blend until mixture is super smooth, adding liqud & seasonings until desired taste/texture is reached. Scoop hummus into 
a dish/tupperware, top with whatever you please. Serve immediately for a smoother hummus, or refrigerate for a few hours first for a thicker hummus. Store in fridge for up to a week.
