Adapted from: OkonomiKitchen.com
Servings: 2-3 (roughly halved)

INGREDIENTS

CURRY
-1tbsp neutral oil, for cooking
-1 large yellow onion, medium dice
-2 garlic cloves, grated
-2tsp ginger, grated
-1 medium/large carrots, peeled and medium diced
-1 large russet or 2 medium golden potatoes, peeled and medium diced
-1 medium sweet potato, medium-small diced (optional)
-1 block superfirm tofu, large dice (or sliced + marinated + baked)
-1/2 a fuji apple, peeled & grated
-~1.5-2.5c water or vegetable stock
-1/2 box curry roux cubes (I used medium hot golden curry, 92g box)
-salt & pepper, to taste
-1/2c white rice, cooked, for serving (2 servings of rice, 1/2c +1c water, boil then reduce to low & cover 15mins, heat off & sit until curry done)

KAKUSHI AJI
-1/2 medium yellow onion, fine dice, caramelized (+1tsp garam masala, a little salt, 1/2tsp fine ground pepper, a splash of sherry)
-1tbsp Hoisin sauce (tonkatsu sauce recommended first, then japanese worcestershire, but this was all I could find at the store and it was still fantastic!)
-1tbsp ketchup
-1.5tbsp dark soy sauce
-1tbsp light brown sugar
-1tsp liquid smoke
-1tsp cocoa powder
-1tsp instant coffee

PROCESS
Caramelize your medium onion until jammy (takes 45mins-1hr, if it needs a little help add 1/8tsp baking soda and a splash of water toward the end), and add it to a container with all your other Kakushi Aji ingredients. Stir to combine, and set aside.
In a large pot/dutch oven, heat on medium-high with oil. Add large yellow onion, and cook for 2mins. Add in garlic and ginger, and fry another minute until fragrant. Add in all veggies (except mushrooms if dehydrated), and cook for 5mins. Add water, grated apple, tofu, and mushrooms (if dehydrated), and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 15-25mins with the lid on, or until your hardest veggie is soft (make sure to check periodically with a butter knife). At this time, open up your roux and chop it up so it's easier to incorporate, and begin cooking your rice. Once your veggies are soft, turn off the heat and add in your roux and kakushi aji. Stir until dissolved/thoroughly combined, and turn the heat back onto low and simmer 5mins to thicken. Adjust salt/soy sauce/etc for flavor if necessary. Serve over rice.
