PROCESS
Add all ingredients except vital wheat gluten to a blender with a dough function (or large food processor) and pulse to mix. Add vital wheat gluten over top in an even coating, and process until dough JUST forms. You may need a little extra water to have it come together. Turn dough out onto counter (or silpat measuring pad), and pat into a 9in disc - do NOT knead. Using a pizza cutter (or knife), cut into 6 equal wedges, shaping them as desired. Loosely wrap each wedge in foil, and place in a steaming basket over medium heat for 30mins, turning once halfway. Once cooked, place steaks in one layer in a shallow dish and pour marinade over top. Flip the steaks around to coat in the marinade evenly, and let sit for at least one hour, preferably overnight. To serve, preheat oven to 400 degrees and place steaks in oven for 10-15mins so that the inside comes up to temp. Baste with marinade and flip halfway through. Once done, sear on lightly oiled griddle or pan on medium-high heat, and baste with more marinade or sauce of choice. before flipping. Serve as desired.
