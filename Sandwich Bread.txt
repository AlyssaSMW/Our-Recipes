source: veganricha.com
servings: 1 loaf

INGREDIENTS
1/2c warm water
-1tbsp sugar
-1tbsp active dry yeast
-1/2c warm vegan milk
-2tbsp oil
-3c bread flour (AP will work too, but bread flour recommended)
-1 1/4tsp kosher salt

PROCESS
In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Proof 5mins. In a large bowl, add all dry ingredients and mix well. Add yeast mixture, oil, and warm milk. Turn out onto a clean surface and knead for 8mins or until dough is soft, smooth, & non-sticky (do NOT add any extra flour, this recipe is perfect). Clean large bowl and add dough back into it, and spray/sprinkle with water. Cover with lid or a towel and proof at room temp for 1.5hrs, or until doubled in size. Punch the dough down, remove from bowl, and roll into a loaf (roll the dough into a 
jelly roll, or pull in and tuck all sides). Place in a greased loaf pan. Spray/sprinkle with water and dust with flour. Cover lightly with a towel and let rise 45mins. Preheat oven to 370F at this time. When dough has risen, bake for 35mins. Remove bread from pan and cool completely on a rack before slicing.
