SPICE BLEND
-1tbsp dried parsley
-2tsp salt
-2tsp paprika, smoked preferred
-1tsp dried thyme
-1tsp cajun seasoning
-1/2tsp MSG
-1/2tsp dried chipotle powder (in place of cayenne, due to lack of smoked sausage, unless I can find them in the future)
-1/4tsp dried sage powder

BROTH
-3-4c water
-2tbsp sherry
-1.5tsp liquid smoke
-1tsp roasted garlic bouillon
-1tsp roasted veggie bouillon

CORN STARCH SLURRY
-1Tbsp corn starch + 2tbsp cold water, dissolved

INGREDIENTS
-2 cans dark red kidney beans, rinsed
-1 pack Beyond Sausage, seared & sliced into coins (or 4 large sausages of choice, or ~1lb)
-1 large yellow onion, finely diced
-1 large green bell pepper, finely diced
-2 stalks celery, finely diced (optional, usually omit)
-2Tbsp minced garlic (roughly 5 LARGE cloves)
-1 bay leaf
-3Tbsp olive oil
-Spice blend (above)
-Broth (above)

RICE
Per serving
-1/3c long grain white rice, washed
-2/3c water
Bring rice & water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 15mins. Once done, turn off the heat & let sit covered for 10mins. Fluff and serve.

PROCESS
In a large deep saucepan over medium heat, saute the bell pepper and onion in the olive oil for 2mins. Add in your spice blend, and stir to coat. Saute for 1min, and then add garlic, stirring constantly until fragrant. Add your beans and stir, and then add your sausage and stir. Add your broth & bay leaf, and stir. Bring to a boil, and then take it down to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Start your rice at this time. Once the rice has 5mins left of rest time, add your corn starch slurry & stir. If not thickened to your liking, add 1tsp corn starch + 1tbsp of cold water's worth of slurry at a time until it's where you want it. Adjust seasonings at this time, and serve over rice.
