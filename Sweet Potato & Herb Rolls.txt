SWEET POTATO & HERB DINNER ROLLS
Source: Vegan Richa
Servings: 8-10

INGREDIENTS
-3/4c non-dairy milk, warmed
-2tsp active yeast
-3/4c sweet potato puree (~1 large sweet potato, roasted in foil @ 450 for 1.5hrs, cooled, & blended)
-2tbsp olive oil (any neutral oil will work as well)
-3c AP flour, divided (1/2c - 1.5c w/ herbs & salt - 1c)
-1.5tsp salt
-2tbsp dried herbs, thyme, rosemary, & sage + whatever else sounds good
-Olive oil or melted butter + garlic powder + dried parsley to brush on at the end

PROCESS
In a large mixing bowl, mix the yeast with the warm non-dairy milk and let sit for 5mins. Then add the sweet potato and 1/2c flour and whisk until no lumps remain. Cover with a towel and let sit 45mins. In a separate small mixing bowl, whisk together 1.5c flour with herbs and salt. Once 45mins is up, add the 2tbsp oil and herbed 1.5c flour to the dough and mix a bit. To the small mixing bowl the flour was just in, add 1c of flour. Working with your hands, add about 1/4 of the bowl of flour to the large mixing bowl at a time until a lightly sticky dough is formed - you may or may not need all the flour, and you do not need to knead it much. Cover bowl with a towel and let rise an hour. 

Preheat the oven to 385F and grease a 7in round springform pan. Using a pizza cutter, score the dough in the bowl into 8 roughly even slices, and sprinkle a light amount of flour over the entire thing. Take each slice of dough and roll into balls using a tucking motion, and arrange evenly in the springform. Brush with oil, cover with a towel, and let rise for another 30mins. Bake for 21mins, let cool a few minutes, and brush with garlic oil or butter. Serve warm. Store in fridge under foil when fully cooled.
