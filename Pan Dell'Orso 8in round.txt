Source: Me, translated & tweaked from a few Italian recipes 
Servings: 1 Cake

INGREDIENTS

Wet:
-6tbsp flax meal + 1/4c water
-1/2c applesauce
-160ml melted butter
-2tbsp vegan honey
-3tsp almond extract
-zest of 3 oranges

Dry:
-130g almonds, chopped
-200g flour
-1tsp baking powder
-1tsp cinnamon
-1/2tsp turmeric
-pinch salt

Chocolate Coating:
-140g dark chocolate
-60g butter or coconut oil

PROCESS
Preheat oven to 350F. Grease & flour an 8in cake pan (round works, domed preferred, anything else also ok). Add the dry ingredients into a bowl and whisk to combine. In a standing mixer, whip the flax eggs and sugar together. Add the appesauce, melted butter, honey, almond extract, and orange zest. Whip until well combined. Add the dry ingredients little by little, mixing until just combined. If too dry, add milk or water as needed. Pour the batter into the cake pan and bake for 60mins, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 1 hour, and then turn onto cooling rack. Once cake is cooled, prepare the glaze: melt the chocolate in a double boiler on medium low heat. Add your fat and stir until completely combined. Pour evenly over fully cooled cake, transfer to plate once dripping has stopped, and place in fridge for a couple of hours until the glaze has set.
