-4 cloves garlic, pressed or sliced or diced
-2 bell peppers, diced, any color
-Any other veggies you may have on hand that you'd like to use, diced
-3 cans beans, any, drained and rinsed
-1 can diced tomatoes, fire roasted or petite diced preferred, any okay; blend into liquid mix if desired
-Any kind of meat, 1/2 package (favorites are soy chorizo, vegan ground beef, soy curls)
OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS

-1 can sweet corn
-2 chipotle chiles, diced
-1 can of green chiles
-1c vegan cheese
-1 package mole


PROCESS: Heat dutch oven (or a large pot) over medium, add cooking oil of choice, and saute onions until translucent. Add garlic, and saute until fragrant. Add the rest of the 
veggies and saute, stirring frequently, until they release liquid and soften a little. Add your meat, optional ingredients, and spices; stir to combine. Cook for a minute, and add
a splash of the liquid to deglaze (loosen & scrape fond from bottom of pot). Add beans, stir to incorporate into other ingredients, and then add the rest of the liquid. You may
need to add a bit of extra water or broth; the liquid level should be just under where the ingredients are in the pot. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, stirring
frequently. Once at a simmer, turn the heat down to medium-low, and put the lid on. Cook for 40mins or more, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing is burning and sticking to
the bottom of the pot. Chili is done when your toughest veggie is fork-tender. If it has not thickened to your liking, add 2tsp of corn starch to 1/4c of water in a small bowl,
and stir until the corn starch is dissolved. Add the slurry to the chili, and stir to combine. Raise the heat to medium and stir frequently until the chili is thickened to your
liking, and then take it off the heat & serve. Keeps in the dutch oven in the fridge for 4-5 days, and in containers in the freezer for up to a month.
